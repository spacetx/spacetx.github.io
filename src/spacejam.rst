SpaceJam Hackathon: An image-based transcriptomics workshop and jamboree
========================================================================

Image-based transcriptomics is an emerging technology that measure gene expression of cells in-situ. The SpaceTx consortium formed among
the developers of these assays in an effort to systematically compare how these assays differentiate cell types in the human brain. A team
of computational biologists and software engineers from CZI are working with SpaceTx to develop `starfish <https://github.com/spacetx/starfish>`__,
an open-source software library that solves many of the computational challenges these assays share in processing these data. Through open
science and open source software, SpaceTx and starfish aim to enable and accelerate the adoption and utility of multiplexed image-based
transcriptomics.

Topics
------

- How to create a spatial census of cell types in a complex brain tissue
- Methods comparison and experimental trade-offs
- Defining a biological target: consensus clustering and probe selection
- Segmentation
- Quality control
- Cell type calling
- Spatial patterning
- New visualization tools

Goals
-----

The goals of this jamboree are to support the completion of the SpaceTx benchmarking effort, which will result in a publication that rigorously
compares and contrasts various image-based transcriptomic assays and create pilot spatial data for the `Human Cell Atlas <https://www.humancellatlas.org/>`__.

When
----

Spacejam was held on February 4th - 7th, 2020.

Hosts
-----

Spacejam is hosted by the `Chan Zuckerberg Initiative <https://chanzuckerberg.com/>`__ and organized in partnership with the `Allen Institute <https://alleninstitute.org/>`__.
