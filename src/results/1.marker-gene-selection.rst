Marker Gene Selection
---------------------

Four different computational strategies:

- (Jeremy M) - Greedy algorithm generally identifies combinatorial genes.  This method was used for completing smaller panels and validating all panels.

- (Kenneth H) Probability model aimed to maximize the average number of levels of a clustering tree correctly classified

- (Brian A) - NS-Forest: Random forest strategy aimed at identifying the most informative markers of specific cell types 

- (Eeshit DV) Random forest strategy which ranks genes based on the overall importance towards classification

(Eeshit DV) These methods were merged together into a ranked list and some gene panels were selected from this list.
