Cell Type Identification in single cell RNASeq data
---------------------------------------------------
The SpaceTx consortium chose the mouse visual cortex as the substrate for spatial transcriptomics comparisons. This was Consensus clustering

Computational strategies:

- (Eeshit DV) SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning) learns an appropriate distance metric for clustering and accounts for drop-outs.  Can also be run as a consensus clustering strategy. (https://github.com/BatzoglouLabSU/SIMLR).

- (Peter K) PAGODA (Pathway And Gene set Over-Dispersion Analysis) resolves multiple aspects of gene expression heterogeneity by testing gene sets for coordinated variability among measured cells                                                                             (http://hms-dbmi.github.io/scde/pagoda.html).

- (Zizhen Y) scrattch.hicat (Hierarchical, Iterative Clustering for Analysis of Transcriptomics) iteratively repeats a multi-step approach on each cluster using different variable genes until no new clusters can be defined, then bootstraps the iterative process (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/scrattch.hicat).

- (Trygve B) - Precursor pipeline used for human MTG

- (Kenneth H) proMMT (Probabilistic Mixture Modeling for Transcriptomics) uses an EM algorithm to iteratively define clusters using the Bayesian information criterion and identify a sparse set of genes varying across clusters (Harris et al 2018; “Classes and continua…”; PLoS Biol.).

Most methods were run multiple times with different parameter settings.

Cluster consensus:

- (Trygve B) - Cluster comparisons using Adjusted Rand, VI, etc. and showing which clusters subclasses /types are split more by various methods

- (Brian A) - Consensus mouse and human clusters were defined using clusterExperiment R library, which clusters the co-occurrence matrix (https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment).

Mouse clusters were defined on VISp + ALM data set and 68 ALM-specific clusters were removed from the consensus clustering, for 191 total clusters
